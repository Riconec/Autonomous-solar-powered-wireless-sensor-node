# Autonomous-solar-powered-wireless-sensor-node
I am trying to make solar powered thermometer (or another type) sensor with wireless capabilities

For this moment I don't have much to say. It will be use NRF24L01+ RF module to transmit data and receive commands. Node itself will be based on STM32F or STM32L with M0 core. Solar cell or solar panel is a source of energy for operating. MPPT system is also can be implemented using ST SPV1050 high efficient energy harvester. I prefer to use supercaps as energy storage. 

This project would be a long story...
